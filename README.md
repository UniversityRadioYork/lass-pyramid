lass-pyramid
============

The Pyramid application that powers the URY website.

This is the code _only_, and is licenced under 2-clause BSD.  It supercedes the `django-lass-*` and `lass` repositories.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.3+
* Setuptools or something else that can understand a "setup.py".

Usage
-----

Use `python setup.py develop` to install the.  Doing this in a virtualenv is recommended.

Use the Pyramid pserve/proutes/etc programs as usual.

Scripts for maintaining the website may be published at a later date.

What's missing
--------------

* Templates
* Assets
* Routing configuration

In addition, since we tend to update all of the website "in step" in a private workflow, updates to this repository from URY may be slow to materialise.
