# Navigation
#
# This section of the website configuration describes the pages that are
# linked through the navigation system.

# 'pages' is the dictionary of all pages known to the navigation system.  It
# has the following format:
#
# PAGE NAME:
#   description: Text that comes up when you mouse over nav links to this page
#   target: URL if it's an external site, ~ROUTE if it's an internal route
#
# If you're wanting to change a page name, just replace it both here and in the
# lists below.  Same goes for URLs; playing around with ~routes is not
# recommended.

# This is the list of pages that come up in the TOP navigation bar.

# follows the following format:
#
# header-nav:

#
# The list here is exactly how it'll look on the website, so ordering and names
# matter.
